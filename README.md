# aws-workshop-samples
This project is currently underdevelopment, but meant to aid anyone that needs to quickly spin up Cloud Development Environments for Demos, Labs, Workshops, Hackathons, or simple POC's in AWS using [Coder](https://coder.com/cde).  These templates and basic Coder admin scripts can be used in any Coder deployment, but are focused on using the [Coder AWS Marketplace](https://coder.com/docs/install/cloud/ec2) AWS EC2 single VM deployment.

1) Follow the steps in the [AWS EC2 Installation Guide](https://coder.com/docs/install/cloud/ec2). Complete the optional step to provide Developers EC2 Workspaces, as the AWS Specific templates provided rely on this capability.  Login using the provided pubic IP, and setup your first Coder user.
2) After successfully logging in, clone this Github repo locally so that the provided AWS Workshop Admin template can be uploaded.
