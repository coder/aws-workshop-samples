# aws-workshop-samples
This project is currently underdevelopment, but meant to aid anyone that needs to quickly spin up Cloud Development Environments for Demos, Labs, Workshops, Hackathons, or simple POC's in AWS using [Coder](https://coder.com/cde).  These templates and basic Coder admin scripts can be used in any Coder deployment, but are focused on using the [Coder AWS Marketplace](https://coder.com/docs/install/cloud/ec2) AWS EC2 single VM deployment to get started quickly.
